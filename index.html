      <h2>Background</h2>
      <br>
    <P>
      I served in the United States Navy as an Airman before pursuing my education. 
      While in the Navy, I gained valuable experience in team management, problem-solving, and leadership.
       After completing my service.I enrolled in Olympic College and began working towards my Associate of Arts degree. I focused on computer 
       science and technology-related courses, which ultimately led me to pursue a career in the software development field.
      Simultaneously, I began working as a salesman at Best Buy. This role allowed me to gain experience in customer service and sales, which helped me to
       develop strong communication and interpersonal skills. These experiences helped me to balance the demands of school and work, and I was able to successfully 
       complete my AA degree while working at Best Buy.
      Currently, I am a Coding student at CodeFellows and I am determined to gain more knowledge and skills in this field. My ultimate goal is to become a successful software developer,
       and I am excited to continue learning and growing in this industry. I am determined to use the skills I have learned from my previous experiences to excel in my studies and future career.
    </P>
